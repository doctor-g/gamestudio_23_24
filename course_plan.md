The course catalog provides this short description of CS414:
> Multidisciplinary teams follow contemporary best practices of game software
> development to begin building an original video game.

The catalog description of CS415 is:
> Continuation of CS 414.  Must be taken in the semester following CS 414.
> Multidisciplinary teams complete and publish an original videogame. 

## Background

You have taken CS390. You know why you are here. Let's make some amazing games.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course sequence, a student will be able to:
- Collaborate on a multidisciplinary team to produce and release an original videogame.
- Explain the facets of a contemporary agile game software development process as manifest on a multidisciplinary game team
- Communicate intermediate and final reports to multiple audiences in various presentation modes

## Evaluation and Grades

### CS414 (Fall)

The alpha milestone is the most significant requirement of the semester. Your alpha milestone
will be considered satisfactory if it meets the following requirements:
- The project meets the Alpha Milestone criteria described in Lemarchand Chapter
  28.
- At least one formal playtest was conducted, with the results analyzed and
  presented in a studio meeting, during the alpha phase.
- Game metrics are incorporated as per the checklist in Lemarchand Chapter 26
  (page 275). The integration, analysis, visualization, and use of feedback to
  refine the game design have been presented to the studio during the alpha
  phase.
- An appropriate bug tracking process is established, documented, and put in
  use.
- Coding standards are established, documented, and followed.
- The milestone is presented at the Alpha Milestone Review.

Each student is expected to complete two one-on-one meetings with the professor
to discuss their progress and performance in the studio&mdash;one at midsemester
and one at the end of the semester. These meetings will result in either a
satisfactory or unsatisfactory performance review. In the case of an
unsatisfactory review, a personal improvement plan will be given to direct the
individual in a positive direction.

---

Individual student grades then will be determined by the following specification.

Meeting these criteria earns a D or better grade.
- Your alpha milestone does not satisfy its requirements before the final exam period begins.
- You complete one of your one-on-one meetings with the professor.
 
Meeting all the previous criteria as well as the following earns a C or better grade:
- Your team's alpha milestone satisfies its requirements before the final exam period begins.
- You have completed both of your one-on-one meetings with the professor.

Meeting all of the previous criteria as well as the following
earns a B or better grade:
- Your team's alpha milestone satisfies its requirements by the published deadline.
- You have successfully started your beta production phase before the start of finals week.
- You have resolved all issues arising from your one-on-one meeting with the professor.

Meeting all of the previous criteria as well as **one** of the
following earns an A grade:
  - You have served as a playtest coordinator and ensured that all of the requirements and goals of the playtest are met.
  - Another team member gives you a commendation for excellence via email to the professor. Each student may give only one such commendation.

Meeting one specification from the grade above your own earns
a plus(&ldquo;+&rdquo;) designation. Earning two from the grade above
your own earns a minus(&ldquo;-&rdquo;) designation of the next 
higher rank.

### Self-Evaluations

A key step to learning from mistakes  is to document your failures.
[Fitzpatrick and Collins-Sussman](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/team-geek/9781449329839/) recommend doing this through
_postmortems_:

> ... [T]he postmortem document isn't just a useless list of apologies or excuses&mdash;that's not its purpose. A proper postmortem should always
contain an explanation of _what was learned_ and _what is going to
change_ as a result of the learning experience. &hellip; Don't erase
your tracks&mdash;light them up like a runway for those who follow you!

Follow these steps to complete your self-evaluation.

1. Read through the team's methodology (NB: the one in your organization, not [the starter one available here](methodology.md)) in light of your performance since the last evaluation. For each item in the methodology, classify your compliance as one of the following:
    - Clearly satisfied
    - Not clearly satisfied
    - Not applicable

2. If any items are not clearly satisfied, write a postmortem. 
The postmortem is an essay whose goal is to highlight what
you have learned from the experience. Regardless of how many items
were not clearly satified, you write only one postmortem, although
that postmortem may be multifaceted.

    A successful postmortem will have the following structure, making
the structure explicit in the document:
    - Summary of what went wrong
    - The primary cause
    - Impact and damage assessment
    - A set of action items to fix the problem immediately
    - A set of action items to prevent the event from happening again
    - Lessons learned

    These action items must be expressed in a manner that is [specific,
    measurable, achievable, relevant, and
    time-bound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria). Each must have a
    deadline by which you propose to have them complete. Most action items
    should be attainable within a few working days at most; if you require more
    time, talk to the instructor about an individualized schedule. Otherwise,
    the expected window of time between the initial self-evaluation and its
    final submission and conclusion is one week.


Self-evaluations will be assessed by the instructor as one of the following:

- *Satisfactory*: The instructor agrees with the evaluation and any action items
  have been addressed.

- *In Progress*: The self-evaluation contains action items that are appropriate but not yet addressed. Resubmit the self-evaluation when the action items are addressed.

- *Needs Revision*: The instructor disagrees with your self-evaluation. Rewrite your self-evaluation, taking the instructor's feedback into account, and resubmit it
within three working days.

To be clear, a self-evaluation is _unsatisfactory_ until it is _satisfactory_.


## Miscellany

### Academic Integrity

Disability Services can be contacted at 765-285-5293 or dsd@bsu.edu.

### Statement on Diversity

The university governance system passed a resolution mandating that the following or a mild variation be included on all course plans:

> Ball State University aspires to be a university that attracts and retains a
> diverse faculty, staff, and student body. We are committed to ensuring that
> all members of the community are welcome, through valuing the various
> experiences and worldviews represented at Ball State and among those we serve.
> We promote a culture of respect and civil discourse as expressed in our
> Beneficence Pledge and through university resources found here.

When the preacher comes to the scramble light and insists that we are all going
to Hell, I expect you to make him feel welcome.
